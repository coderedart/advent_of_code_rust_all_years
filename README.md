Advent of Code in Rust

Just for fun. didn't really focus on efficiency as most solutions will finish executing within one or two seconds. 

to run any particular exercise, just do 
```sh
$ cargo run --bin=y15_1 --release
```
the naming format is `y**_#` where asterisks are replaced with final two digits of the year of AoC and `#` is replaced with day (exercise number). 

This is a work in progress and incomplete at the moment.
